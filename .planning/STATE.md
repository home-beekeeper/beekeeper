# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-26)

**Core value:** A hijacked or off-task agent cannot successfully act on the developer's machine without Beekeeper deciding to permit it.
**Current focus:** Phase 5 — Linux Sentry — next up

## Current Position

Phase: 5 of 9 (Linux Sentry) — COMPLETE
Plan: Phase 5 verified (5/5)
Status: Phase 5 verified — ready for Phase 6 (macOS Sentry)
Last activity: 2026-05-28 — Phase 5 UAT passed: 13 pass, 0 fail, 2 skip (linux CI); 17/17 packages green

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 33%

## Phase 1 Completion Summary

### Plans completed (all 6/6)

| Wave | Plan | Title | Commit | Status |
|------|------|-------|--------|--------|
| 1 | 01 | Project Scaffold | 5c0c515 | ✅ Done |
| 2 | 02 | Catalog Sync + mmap index | 009284d | ✅ Done |
| 2 | 03 | Self-Defense (builds/signing) | e81b019 | ✅ Done |
| 3 | 04 | Pure Policy Engine (TDD) | afd5f67 | ✅ Done |
| 4 | 05 | NDJSON Audit Logging | f5d6489 | ✅ Done |
| 5 | 06 | Hook Handler + Selftest | 88c34bb | ✅ Done |

### UAT results (01-UAT.md — all automated)

- Build + vet: pass
- Full test suite (6 packages): pass
- `beekeeper version`: pass
- `beekeeper init`: pass
- `beekeeper catalogs sync` (654 entries, mmap index): pass
- `beekeeper check` clean package → allow, exit 0: pass
- `beekeeper check` nrwl.angular-console@18.95.0 → warn, exit 0: pass
- `beekeeper check` malformed JSON → block, exit 1 (fail-closed): pass
- `beekeeper selftest` → PASS: 7, FAIL: 0: pass
- `beekeeper audit tail` wired (no "not yet implemented"): pass
- Self-defense files (Makefile, goreleaser, SECURITY.md, Renovate, CI, release): pass
- `go mod verify` → all modules verified: pass

### Known constraints carried forward

- `go test -race` requires CGO + C compiler (not installed on Windows dev machine); race gate runs in CI
- `make verify-release` requires `make` (not installed on Windows); reproducibility logic validated manually; CI covers it
- Phase 1 is single-source warn semantics only; corroboration-based block enforcement is Phase 2

## Phase 3 Completion Summary

### Plans completed (all 5/5)

| Wave | Plan | Title | Commit | Status |
|------|------|-------|--------|--------|
| 1 | 03-01 | EDXT-01 extension install recognition + deps | 69536fd | ✅ Done |
| 1 | 03-02 | Marketplace adapter + quarantine manager | a84a742 | ✅ Done |
| 2 | 03-03 | fsnotify watch daemon + manifest parser + handler | e4e3ba4 | ✅ Done |
| 2 | 03-05 | Editor detection + JSONC settings patch + selftest fixture | 7b1aa9d | ✅ Done |
| 3 | 03-04 | Scan orchestrator + watch/scan/quarantine CLI + init | 9428ed3 | ✅ Done |

### Key deliverables

- `internal/policy`: EDXT-01 extension-install recognition (code --install-extension, cursor, windsurf)
- `internal/catalog`: Open VSX + VS Code Marketplace age adapters; marketplace-cache on disk
- `internal/quarantine`: list/restore/purge operations; per-item metadata NDJSON
- `internal/watch`: fsnotify daemon + manifest parser + quarantine/notify handler (EDXT-02, EDXT-03)
- `internal/editorinit`: editor detection (VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf) + JSONC settings patch
- `internal/scan`: Bumblebee subprocess orchestrator + Beekeeper-own per-extension scan (EDXT-04)
- `internal/config`: WatchSettings + AddWatchDirectory + Save
- `cmd/beekeeper/main.go`: watch, scan, quarantine, extended init commands (EDXT-04, EDXT-05, EDXT-06)

### Deviations from plan

- `evaluateExtension` in scanner.go duplicates adapter construction from handler.go (noted; minimal, not shared because handler.go is quarantine/notify coupled)
- `notify.Config{Enabled: true}` hardcoded in newWatchCmd (notification preferences deferred to a future phase)
- `quarantine_restore`/`quarantine_purge` audit RecordTypes differ from standard `policy_decision` schema (acceptable for Phase 3 audit trail)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 20
- Average duration: ~10 min/plan

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 (Foundation + Hook Handler) | 6/6 | ~10 min |
| 2 (Policy Engine + Multi-Source Catalogs) | 9/9 | ~10 min |
| 3 (Editor Extension Defense) | 5/5 | ~10 min |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Recent decisions from Phase 3:

- Injectable `runBumblebeeFn` package var for test isolation without real binary (Windows portability)
- Pre-seeded marketplace cache pattern for tests (avoids live network; same as handler_test.go)
- `catalog.NewMultiIndex` nil-safe: nil first arg skips Bumblebee source gracefully
- `WatchSettings` added to Config as pointer field (omitempty — backward-compatible)
- `quarantine_restore`/`quarantine_purge` NDJSON records use custom RecordType values (outside standard schema — acceptable for Phase 3 completeness)

Earlier decisions from Phase 1 (full log in PROJECT.md):

- `CatalogLookup` interface decouples policy engine from concrete mmap type (testability)
- `internal/audit/FromDecision` takes caller-supplied recordID/timestamp (purity)
- Selftest uses `//go:embed corpus/fixtures.json` — no runtime file dependency
- `npm install` command shape maps to `npm` ecosystem; editor extensions tested via direct `editor-extension` shape
- BEEI v1 mmap index format (magic 0x42454549, sorted 48-byte records, sha256 key, LE offsets)

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 4: MCP client differences (Claude Code vs Cursor) expose different edge cases; July 2026 spec SDK lag
- Phase 4: MCP message parser must be fuzz-tested before v0.6.0 as a release gate (not backlog item)
- Phase 5: eBPF CI matrix needs Ubuntu 20.04 (kernel 5.4) and 22.04 (kernel 5.15) — ubuntu-latest alone is insufficient
- Phase 7: eslogger field coverage incomplete from documentation — build parser against real eslogger output on macos-latest CI only

## Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and carried forward:

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| Testing | `go test -race` requires CGO/C compiler | CI-only | Phase 1 |
| Build | `make verify-release` requires make on Windows | CI-only | Phase 1 |
| Audit | Log rotation, sinks (syslog/OTLP/HTTPS) | Phase 6 | Phase 1 |
| Hooks | `beekeeper hooks install` (INTG-01) | Phase 4 | Phase 1 |
| Watch | `notify.Config` wired to config preferences | Future phase | Phase 3 |
| Cursor | Windows extension-dir path (Assumption A1) | Needs live validation | Phase 3 |
